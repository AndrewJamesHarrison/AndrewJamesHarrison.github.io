        <h2 id="the-rabbit-keeper">The Rabbit Keeper</h2>
        <p>She was born in Spring, but awoke in Autumn. They taught her the names of all the forest creatures.<br />Her uncle tipped his large black hat, and smoke rose from the cigar in his mouth. She stared at his face. Some of him was deepest black, some of him was blinding white. Just like her.<br />He threw a ball to her, and she caught it. She threw it back, and he caught it. It was their game, and they played until nightfall.<br />Her father carried her, cradled in his dark cloak, hiding his old bones. Her aunts and uncles, and the rest of her family followed.</p>
        <p>They showed her the animals.</p>
        <p>Next summer, it would be her job to keep the rabbits, the hens and the mice. Then, the summer after that, she would keep the dogs, the cats and the fish. The summer after, the foxes, the deer, and the bears.<br />On and on they said, each year she would keep more and more. Eventually, she would keep the children, the adults, and the elders.<br />Autumn was over now, and Winter had come. She slept through Winter, and awoke in Spring.</p>
        <p>She was under her father&#39;s cloak, draped over his farmers scythe. He was never without his cloak. Or his scythe.</p>
        <p>&quot;One day, you&#39;ll have your own tool. You&#39;ll use it to guide, to keep your flock safe. It will be your most important possession, just as the scythe is mine. You&#39;re uncle&#39;s cigar is his. Your grandmother&#39;s scales were hers.&quot;</p>
        <p>Her father would never leave her, or the cloak, or the scythe. She knew this deep, in the marrow of her bones.<br />Her family were gone. Nowhere to be found, and there was chaos.<br />The rabbits overflowed the hutch, consuming all of the plants and grass. They were all sick, and hungry, and ravenous. Many should have been taken by winter, and kept by her father, or her uncle.<br />It wasn&#39;t her job yet. It wasn&#39;t Summer.</p>
        <p>But still, she approached them, and stretched out her hand. For the first time, she touched them, slowly caressing their fur, petting their heads, stroking their whiskers.<br />If there was no one to do the job, then she resolved to start hers early.<br />The rabbits were easiest, and she understood why they were first. The hens and the mice were harder, but she took them all the same. The ones that should have passed in winter, that were long overdue now.<br />Alive against their will, against the natural order, poisoning those that should still live. And tears welled in her eyes.</p>
        <p>The dogs, the cats and the fish. They would be harder. But she had her father&#39;s cloak, and so she was hidden from them, and she kept them. The ones that should have passed in winter.<br />She could feel their empty hearts, see their blank eyes, and touch their broken bones. And she cried for them.</p>
        <p>The foxes, the dear and the bears. She thought they would be too much, that she would be unable to keep them, to care for them.<br />But she had to try all the same. She had her father&#39;s scythe. And it helped. She swayed, she swung, and she cut. And she wept for them.</p>
        <p>Last, was the hardest of all. The children, the adults and the elders. As she entered the village, she saw they had been taken already, by a strange man. A strange man, covered in stitches, and smoking her uncle&#39;s cigar.<br />A man whose arms were strangers to his legs, and his legs were strangers to his chest, and even his chest was a stranger to his head. And when he saw her, he dropped her uncle&#39;s cigar, and he ran.<br />His strange legs, too long for his body. His strange arms, too thin for his chest.</p>
        <p>She picked up her uncle&#39;s cigar, and she followed the strange man. He ran through the gate, and the church, and the tower.<br />As she neared the gate, she saw a strange dog, covered in stitches. His feet were strangers to his legs, and his legs were strangers to his body. Even his body was a stranger to his head.<br />The strange dog was not meant to be here. He was meant to have passed, probably many winters ago. Same as the strange man.</p>
        <p>The dog barked and growled, and snarled. He would not be kept by her. He refused.<br />She looked at her father&#39;s cloak, and knew it would not help. Then his scythe, and knew it would not help. She looked at her uncle&#39;s cigar, and knew it would not help.<br />She shut her eyes, and in her mind, the ball appeared. The one she would throw, to her uncle, and her father. The ball they would throw to her.<br />She opened her eyes, and threw the ball to the strange dog. And he caught it. And when she opened the gate, the strange dog brought it to her. And she caressed his fur. Pet his head, stroked his whiskers.</p>
        <p>She opened the door to the church, and inside was her family. Trapped behind glass, behind iron and silver. The strange man was keeping them, and she knew it was to stop himself from being kept. He was afraid.<br />The strange dog followed her, and she opened the door to the tower. Inside, the strange man hurried. He was building a new contraption, of glass, and iron and silver. One that was meant for her.<br />She looked at the strange dog, ball still held in his mouth, and told him to go to his master.<br />The strange men scratched the strange dog&#39;s ear, and then plucked the ball from his mouth.</p>
        <p>He froze. He stared, and he whispered.</p>
        <p>She walked, she turned, and she danced.</p>
        <p>He didn&#39;t move now, fear had overcome him. She returned the cigar to him, and he smoked it. She touched the ball in his hand, and he dropped it.</p>
        <p>She drew the scythe against the thread, and she cut it.</p>
        <p>And they fell away. First his fingers, and his hands, and his arms. Second his toes, and his feet, and his legs. Third his chest, and his neck, and his head.</p>
        <p>She opened the glass, and the iron, and the silver. And her father smiled. And her uncle clapped. And she danced.</p>
