        <h2 id="the-rabbit-keeper">The Rabbit Keeper</h2>
        <p>She was born in Spring, but awoke in Autumn. They taught her the names of all the forest creatures.<br />Her
          uncle tipped his large black hat, and smoke rose from the cigar in his mouth. She stared at his face. Some of
          him was deepest black, some of him was blinding white. Just like her.<br />He threw a ball to her, and she
          caught it. She threw it back, and he caught it. It was their game, and they played until nightfall.<br />Her
          father carried her, cradled in his dark cloak, hiding his old bones. Her aunts and uncles, and the rest of her
          family followed.</p>
        <p>They showed her the animals.</p>
        <p>Next summer, it would be her job to keep the rabbits, the hens and the mice. Then, the summer after that, she
          would keep the dogs, the cats and the fish. The summer after, the foxes, the deer, and the bears.<br />On and
          on they said, each year she would keep more and more. Eventually, she would keep the children, the adults, and
          the elders.<br />Autumn was over now, and Winter had come. She slept through Winter, and awoke in Spring.</p>
        <p>She was under her father&#39;s cloak, draped over his farmers scythe. He was never without his cloak. Or his
          scythe.</p>
        <p>&quot;One day, you&#39;ll have your own tool. You&#39;ll use it to guide, to keep your flock safe. It will be
          your most important possession, just as the scythe is mine. You&#39;re uncle&#39;s cigar is his. Your
          grandmother&#39;s scales were hers.&quot;</p>
        <p>Her father would never leave her, or the cloak, or the scythe. She knew this deep, in the marrow of her
          bones.<br />Her family were gone. Nowhere to be found, and there was chaos.<br />The rabbits overflowed the
          hutch, consuming all of the plants and grass. They were all sick, and hungry, and ravenous. Many should have
          been taken by winter, and kept by her father, or her uncle.<br />It wasn&#39;t her job yet. It wasn&#39;t
          Summer.</p>
        <p>But still, she approached them, and stretched out her hand. For the first time, she touched them, slowly
          caressing their fur, petting their heads, stroking their whiskers.<br />If there was no one to do the job,
          then she resolved to start hers early.<br />The rabbits were easiest, and she understood why they were first.
          The hens and the mice were harder, but she took them all the same. The ones that should have passed in winter,
          that were long overdue now.<br />Alive against their will, against the natural order, poisoning those that
          should still live. And tears welled in her eyes.</p>
        <p>The dogs, the cats and the fish. They would be harder. But she had her father&#39;s cloak, and so she was
          hidden from them, and she kept them. The ones that should have passed in winter.<br />She could feel their
          empty hearts, see their blank eyes, and touch their broken bones. And she cried for them.</p>
        <p>The foxes, the dear and the bears. She thought they would be too much, that she would be unable to keep them,
          to care for them.<br />But she had to try all the same. She had her father&#39;s scythe. And it helped. She
          swayed, she swung, and she cut. And she wept for them.</p>
        <p>Last, was the hardest of all. The children, the adults and the elders. As she entered the village, she saw
          they had been taken already, by a strange man. A strange man, covered in stitches, and smoking her uncle&#39;s
          cigar.<br />A man whose arms were strangers to his legs, and his legs were strangers to his chest, and even
          his chest was a stranger to his head. And when he saw her, he dropped her uncle&#39;s cigar, and he
          ran.<br />His strange legs, too long for his body. His strange arms, too thin for his chest.</p>
        <p>She picked up her uncle&#39;s cigar, and she followed the strange man. He ran through the gate, and the
          church, and the tower.<br />As she neared the gate, she saw a strange dog, covered in stitches. His feet were
          strangers to his legs, and his legs were strangers to his body. Even his body was a stranger to his
          head.<br />The strange dog was not meant to be here. He was meant to have passed, probably many winters ago.
          Same as the strange man.</p>
        <p>The dog barked and growled, and snarled. He would not be kept by her. He refused.<br />She looked at her
          father&#39;s cloak, and knew it would not help. Then his scythe, and knew it would not help. She looked at her
          uncle&#39;s cigar, and knew it would not help.<br />She shut her eyes, and in her mind, the ball appeared. The
          one she would throw, to her uncle, and her father. The ball they would throw to her.<br />She opened her eyes,
          and threw the ball to the strange dog. And he caught it. And when she opened the gate, the strange dog brought
          it to her. And she caressed his fur. Pet his head, stroked his whiskers.</p>
        <p>She opened the door to the church, and inside was her family. Trapped behind glass, behind iron and silver.
          The strange man was keeping them, and she knew it was to stop himself from being kept. He was afraid.<br />The
          strange dog followed her, and she opened the door to the tower. Inside, the strange man hurried. He was
          building a new contraption, of glass, and iron and silver. One that was meant for her.<br />She looked at the
          strange dog, ball still held in his mouth, and told him to go to his master.<br />The strange men scratched
          the strange dog&#39;s ear, and then plucked the ball from his mouth.</p>
        <p>He froze. He stared, and he whispered.</p>
        <p>She walked, she turned, and she danced.</p>
        <p>He didn&#39;t move now, fear had overcome him. She returned the cigar to him, and he smoked it. She touched
          the ball in his hand, and he dropped it.</p>
        <p>She drew the scythe against the thread, and she cut it.</p>
        <p>And they fell away. First his fingers, and his hands, and his arms. Second his toes, and his feet, and his
          legs. Third his chest, and his neck, and his head.</p>
        <p>She opened the glass, and the iron, and the silver. And her father smiled. And her uncle clapped. And she
          danced.</p>

      <div class="page storm-chaser page-hidden">
        <h2 id="stormchaser">Stormchaser</h1>
          <p>The ocean swelled and raged, spurred onwards by the southerly wind. The winds had been blowing this way for
            twelve years, beating back any ship that would attempt to cross northwards, and land on the green
            beaches.<br />Lining the shore, trees bent, desperately grasping the ground. One might think they were
            afraid of falling up into the sky, such was their hold on the Earth.<br />Foreigners called this land The
            Canopy - for it&#39;s lush and numerous forests. Inhabitants called it Shaman&#39;s land. To do otherwise
            was treason. The Shaman had no tolerance for treason.<br />For twelve years she had been the Shaman. Like
            her sister before her, and her mother, and her grandmother, her word was law. She alone controlled the
            weather here, her power was so great.<br />At her whim, the winds would change. But she had no such whim.
            Any travelers from the South were sure to be crushed in the waves if they dared brave them. That was her
            command.</p>
          <p>Her subjects feared her, as the mouse fears the hawk. They served her completely, never wavering, never
            questioning. Those few doubters had been removed when she took the palace from her sister.<br />The strength
            of her family&#39;s magic was absolute. Unconquerable. And hers even more so. She had discovered at fifteen,
            that her sister could not best her. And since her sister had taken the palace from their mother.<br />Well.
            It was only natural that she should hold power over Shaman&#39;s Land. The strongest will consumes all.
            Those were her grandmothers words.<br />Her grandmother had abdicated the palace, and left it to her mother.
            She had recognized the strongest willed, and conceded her power. This was the way it should have been. But
            her sister had rebelled. She had challenged her power. Challenges could not be ignored.</p>
          <p>
            So now, she was not only the strongest. She was the only. Her sister had birthed only sons, and the magic
            was only passed from mother to daughter.<br />But despite her power. Despite her dominance, she had not born
            a child. It pressed on her mind, and in response, her will grew stronger. Unseen forces tore at the
            forests.<br />The many creatures of the sky were thrown haphazardly. Homes left the ground, and the people
            with them. Refuse swirled in the air, as her anger grew. No one had seen power of this strength before. She
            would prove her strength every day. She would impose her will upon the land, until she had made her reality.
            Her rage swelled, and there was no keeping it hidden. Her anger and her will, one and the same. Her subjects
            collapsed in desperation. Others were carried away, up into the sky. Eventually, the bodies would return.
            The anger was worse now, stronger even, then the time she had been challenged. Her family was supposed to
            love her. Support her. Her
            sister should have known she was strongest. Her sister should not have forced her to kill.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ocean swelled and raged, spurred onwards by the southerly wind. A single, solitary ship, braved the
            turbulence. It skipped over the chaos, and the lone sailor caressed the waves.<br />If they had not been
            dashed against the beach, the fishermen could have warned the scouts. If they had not been trampled under
            the hooves of their mounts, the scouts could have warned the sentries. If they had been carried into the
            sky, then her sentries could have warned her personal guard. And if her personal guard had not been crushed
            against the floor, by the supreme and ultimate power of her will, her personal guard could have warned her.
            So instead, the lone sailor carried her ship over the turbulent waves. The sailor skipped from her ship, and
            laid on the green beaches. She had not felt the grasses in so many years after all. She frolicked, making
            her way in a leisurely fashion. While the ground was swept into the sky, and the sky crashed into the
            ground, the sailor continued, towards
            the palace.
          </p>
          <p>The doors to the palace had been flung open by the wind, and torn from the hinges. The shaman glared out
            the empty hole, directing her rage to sweep the land. Towards the palace now, approached the sailor, face
            hidden by hood and cloak. The wind carried homes, and horses, and ships, but it did not touch the sailor.
            The Shaman steeled herself, and renewed her will. From around her, chairs, tables, carpets - all of her
            possessions were taken by the wind, and aimed at the sailor. The sailor carefully placed a foot on the first
            chair, and continued her dance. The sailor leapt from chair, to chair, to table, to carpet. Unbound by wind.
            Unmoved by will. Tears streamed down The Shaman&#39;s face now. Was she not the strongest, after all? She
            waited for the knife, or the sword, or the axe, that was surely under the Sailor&#39;s cloak. But there was
            no knife. No sword, and no axe. Only a cloak, wrapping around her now.</p>
          <p>&quot;The strongest will consumes all.&quot; Her grandmother&#39;s words emerged from the cloak, echoing
            through the palace halls.</p>
          <p>&quot;It consumed your mother. It consumed your sister. And now, it reaches it&#39;s final destination. To
            consume you.&quot;</p>
          <p>The Shaman gasped, but could not breathe. The wind stole her breath, and finally, she understood her
            grandmother&#39;s words.</p>
          <p>She willed herself to not to be consumed. She willed herself to release it, knowing she would never wield
            it again. Never grasp the wind. Never even feel the air.</p>
          <p>She held in her hands, the empty cloak.</p>
          <p>For the first time in 12 years, no wind blew over Shaman&#39;s land.</p>

        <h3 id="the-job">The Job</h3>
        <p>I resisted the urge to scratch. Last thing I needed now was to tear up my old scalp. The locals were already
          repulsed by me.<br>If it wasn&#39;t for my hunched shoulders, oily burnt skin, crooked nose, scraggly hair and
          beard, I would be the picture of confidence.<br>But my appearance did lead credence to my story. Even though
          my story was a lie.<br>It all factored into my reputation, you see. As a wizard. Yes, the great and powerful
          Velathorix. The horrible old mage, able to curse your enemy, and his unborn sons.<br>Residing in the old
          ruined house, where that old woman had died of the pox.<br>I&#39;d been performing illusions on the streets of
          this beautiful town for months, entertaining passerbys with my myriad of tricks.</p>
        <p><em>And paying the street urchins to relieve my audience of their pockets and bags</em></p>
        <p>Nevermind that the odd coin or card trick required no supernatural power, I wasn&#39;t about to tell my marks
          that.</p>
        <p>I was worried though. Recently, soldiers had been flooding the town, and word was the king&#39;s brother was
          coming with an army to take it by force.<br>I thought the priest had come to move me along, when I saw him in
          the crowd. An upstanding member of the church shouldn&#39;t be seen engaging with a vile street wizard, such
          as myself.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve heard they call you Velathorix. Did you pick that name because it sounded
          intimidating? Or are you secretly a fan of the 7th testament?&quot;<br>I chuckled under my breath as we
          walked, but said nothing. I hoped I would make him uncomfortable enough to leave me alone. The last thing I
          wanted was scrutiny from the bloody church.<br>&quot;Okay, Velathorix. I can understand that you are ...
          apprehensive, talking to me.&quot; I waited for him to continue, but he was clearly trying to bait out a
          response.<br>I flicked my hand up abruptly, hoping to make him flinch, and casually swept my unkempt hair out
          of me eyes.</p>
        <p>We continued down the cobblestone path, I exaggerating my limp, and he paying it no attention. Damn, he was
          sharp.<br>I supposed he must be familiar with beggars and con men, in his position at the church, and that he
          had correctly assessed my exaggerations as the work of an experienced hustler.<br>We continued, the silence
          building between us, the gears in my mind grinding against each other. I&#39;d been planning to collect the
          snakeskin bag from the urchins, before they could spend it&#39;s contents.<br>But the priest continued by my
          side, and I had to deal with him before I could go about my business.<br>&quot;Look, you must know I&#39;m no
          fan of the church, or any of your damned testaments. Why are you following me? I&#39;m an old man with weary
          bones, and I know you have no interest in my petty parlor tricks.&quot;</p>
        <p>The priest smiled, and launched into his spiel as if we hadn&#39;t been walking in complete silence for the
          past 5 minutes.<br>&quot;My name is Father Faust. I have been tasked by the king&#39;s chancellor with a most
          unusual request.&quot; He paused for an uncomfortable amount of time, and I was about to start on him, when he
          continued<br>&quot;There&#39;s an army approaching our town. An army belonging to the king&#39;s younger
          brother, Prince Alverson. The king has of course, responded by assembling a force within the
          town.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, I&#39;d noticed the glut of young men coming around, stomping about and frightening
          the locals.&quot; I tried to make my sneer a scathing one.<br>&quot;Hm, well there&#39;s a rumour going around
          the soldiers, that Prince Alverson has a secret weapon. A wizard of considerable vile power, that could easily
          dismantle the towns defenses.&quot;<br>A rising sound escaped my belly, my shoulders shook as I laughed
          loudly, shirking my feeble persona.<br>&quot;I see. So you&#39;ve been tasked with finding your own vile
          magician, to what end?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh. No, I don&#39;t believe this wizard is any threat to the men. I&#39;m fully aware that you are
          simple tricksters, worming your way into feebleminded men&#39;s fears.<br>But that&#39;s not to say you
          don&#39;t have value. This enemy is no more a threat then you are.&quot;<br>He pushed my shoulder, and I would
          have clattered to the floor, except he used his other hand to catch me. I glared at him, and swept my hair out
          of my eyeline again.<br>&quot;Not going to curse me, are you?&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Now, unfortunately, the
          regular man does not understand that you&#39;re a simple confidence man.&quot;<br>I kept my glare fixed on
          him, hoping I would see him falter or panic, but he betrayed no sign of worry. Once again, I resigned to
          myself, he was above being fooled.<br>&quot;Which is why, I&#39;m here, talking to you. Since the rabble so
          whole heartedly believe an agent of evil has been employed by the enemy, the king wants a similar force on our
          side.<br>Someone that can belay the men&#39;s fears, give them some confidence that the dastardly wizard will
          be too busy fighting one of his own kind to turn his ire on them.&quot;</p>
        <p>Well, now the priest was talking my language. I straightened out my shoulders, and relaxed my posture, now
          half a head taller then I&#39;d been seconds ago.<br>We continued walking, he much the same, and my limp,
          hardly noticeable.<br>&quot;I suppose we could discuss an arrangement. I assume there will be generous
          compensation. I&#39;ll require payment in silver.&quot;<br>Father Faust gave me a curious glance, surprised at
          my newfound agility. Maybe he hadn&#39;t realised the full scope of my act after all.<br>&quot;I&#39;m a very
          confidant man, Father Faust.&quot;</p>
        <h3 id="the-plan">The Plan</h3>
        <p>We had a scarce few weeks to prepare for the oncoming battle. Prince Alverson assembled his fighting force
          from the western cities, they took some time to organise and march.<br>I&#39;d scrounged up every piece of
          information I could find on the enemy wizard in his employ. Thankfully, he was familiar. The
          Forizian.<br>I&#39;d seen his act several times, and he was damned good. Bold, self assured, he played a very
          dangerous game. Fire was his specialty, and it took great skill to not get burned.</p>
        <p>My initial assessment was bolstered, as I talked to the sentries keeping tabs on the enemy
          positions.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve seen it, wizard. I&#39;ve seen him summon flames from the earth, and extinguish
          them just as easily.&quot;<br>I smiled knowingly. Yes, he&#39;d obviously improved his act if he&#39;d managed
          to fool this prince. Or even if the prince was just using him to boost the confidence of his army.<br>It took
          a lot of trust, and desperation for someone born so high, to stoop so low.</p>
        <p>Faust had introduced me to the chancellor as well, a round man that had little interest in my talents. He
          clearly had his hands in multiple pots, refusing to bet too hard on any one factor.<br>I&#39;d have to play
          Faust harder if I wanted to profit.
          &quot;Father Faust. We have something very important to discuss.&quot; He massaged his temple. This was the
          fourth time I had goaded him into a conversation.<br>He obviously expected it to be about my payment, but each
          time I pivoted away from the matter.<br>&quot;It&#39;s about redemption.&quot; I watched the confusion in his
          eyes, flow down to his frown.<br>&quot;I know our enemy magician well. He&#39;s wise, and well travelled.
          Quite famous in the Westlands. He performed his magic in theatres and for gentlemen and ladies of high
          standing.<br>I would expect that by now, the common men of our town would know of his reputation.&quot;<br>His
          frown had developed into a scowl, and I hoped I wasn&#39;t laying my act on too thick.
          &quot;We will not convince our soldiers that I am some marvelously capable wizard, able to overpower his
          magic. Or, even if we did, we might not reduce their fear of the enemy, so much as increase their fear of
          magic.&quot;</p>
        <p>He took some time to mull over my words. He was a man of god after all, and couldn&#39;t have loved the idea
          of encouraging a belief in sorcery.<br>&quot;Ok. What&#39;s your point? What does that have to do with
          redemption? And if you can&#39;t discredit this enemy wizard, then what use are you to me?&quot;<br>A devilish
          grin spread across my cheek.<br>&quot;I can ruin the wizards reputation among our men. But not with magic. I
          will have to employ something more trustworthy. Something... holier.&quot; I glanced. Still
          confused.<br>&quot;You were right, I called myself Velathorix because it sounds threatening, I held no
          allusion to the testaments. But it&#39;s a lucky coincidence. Much like my namesake, I could use redemption in
          the eyes of our gods.<br>The Forizian will make a great showing of his fire on the battlefield, Faust. I plan
          to show his magic is powerless against true believers in our lord.&quot;</p>
        <h3 id="the-battle">The Battle</h3>
        <p>Our soldiers stood, shining and glorious, as the sun crept above the rocky crags in the East. Formed across
          from us, merely a cavalry charge away - stood our enemy. The Westlands Alliance.<br>At their head, a figure
          and his steed clad in green and black. Prince Alverson, I assumed. I was curiously yet to see my counterpart,
          The Forizian. Idly, I wondered if he would recognise me.<br>I struggled to remember the name I had used at the
          time, and what kind of disguise I had worn. Maybe I was Dellator, the magical carpenter? Oravalder, the
          southern merchant from across the sea?<br>No matter. Now I was a single unarmed figure, covered by a heavy
          cloak. The soldiers kept their distance, I stank of flashfire oil.<br>As me eyes scanned the front line of
          enemy troops, a horrible realisation dawned on me. I had seen The Forizian.<br>My head swiveled, as I laid
          eyes upon him. I had passed over him, assuming another knight, but no, he held a banner, picturing a man
          surrounded by flame. That made it obvious now.</p>
        <p>Riding a pale horse, and wearing a full suit of armour, my mind boggled. He was a knight of the
          Westlands?<br>My thoughts were cut short, as he rode in front of the lines, and raised his banner. He was
          starting the show.<br>My eyes flicked around the battlefield. Fire erupted from the ground, The Forizian and
          his steed toured his line of soldiers.<br>I felt our lines shrink, men gasping, shields lowering. Our enemy
          was putting on a masterful show, and we were a captive audience.<br>They had picked a terrible battlefield to
          fight our cavalry, and it was obvious to me that victory lied in seizing the initiative.<br>But they&#39;d
          played their hand perfectly - the archers were stunned, and the horses were terrified. By the gods, our line
          might break without a single death, their display was so great.</p>
        <p>The enemy infantry began their advance, and I threw a glance to Father Faust. His eyes pleaded with me. I
          think they&#39;d waited long enough. Time to reveal my hand.<br>While our men refused to budge, I approached
          the enemy line. My eyes remained glued to the man clad in flames, riding his pale horse.<br>Somewhere behind
          me, I heard Father Faust start the speech we&#39;d prepared. I only hoped our other priests followed suit.</p>
        <p><strong>&quot;Trust in the gods, the firetender, the watcher, the hunter! Believe not the illusions of our
            enemy! Believe not in the devils flames!&quot;</strong></p>
        <p>Father Faust&#39;s voice faded in my ears as I continued my march. I trusted in one thing above all else. The
          Forizian&#39;s sense of theatrics.</p>
        <p>The Forizian raised his banner again. My hands shifted beneath my cloak, specially fashioned from wetsilk -
          it would protect me from the flames for a precious few seconds.<br>I sparked the flint in my hands, and my
          cloak caught alight right on cue. Fire erupted from the ground.<br>&quot;Please gods, forgive me for my
          sins!&quot;<br>The thin layer of pungent oil covering my cloak burned with it&#39;s trademark speed, and I
          turned my back to our enemy. The fire rose up, surrounding my body.<br>&quot;I repent!&quot;<br>And then the
          flashfire oil was done, the thin spread burned away, not hot enough to burn the wetsilk cloak.</p>
        <p>Father Faust&#39;s voice returned to my ears.</p>
        <p><strong>&quot;As told by the testaments, even the sins of Velathorix can be absolved!&quot;</strong></p>
        <p>A cheer erupted from our line, and the cavalry spurred on, despite the protest of the horses.</p>
        <h3 id="the-silver">The Silver</h3>
        <p>I fled the battle, confidant in our victory. It was no place for an old trickster, and I had to fetch the
          payment stashed away.<br>I was sure the silver wouldn&#39;t last long in my possession, before some more
          upstanding men decided I must have stolen it. How else would an old hustler own such a thing?<br>I hauled the
          bucket up the unused water well. No one knew I&#39;d replaced the rotten rope.<br>People were too afraid to
          enter this old house, ever since that old women had died of pox here. I hadn&#39;t even made up a name for
          her, but still the peasants believed the story.</p>
        <p>I fashioned my cloak into a bundle, holding the king&#39;s silver bars, and removed my clothes. These, I
          would have to burn. I turned a silver bar over, regarding my reflection.<br>My hunched shoulders.<br>My oily
          skin.<br>My crooked nose.<br>My scraggly beard.<br>I straightened my shoulders and back, for the first time in
          hours. I wonder if pretending to have this stoop would eventually give me a real one.<br>I spread a cream over
          my skin, and left it to sit. Removing it would take the filth and oil away, revealing my natural tan
          complexion.<br>Raising a hand to my face, I teared at the crooked clay affixed there. Underneath lay the small
          upturned nose I had hidden for so long.<br>Next, the clay on my chin, with scraggly hairs interspersed
          throughout. And the clay on my head, falling to the floor along with dirty matted hair.<br>Cutting away the
          pig skin I had tucked my real hair into was the end. Velathorix was dead.<br>Stretching out my neck, I
          tenderly touched the clay pretending to be an Adam&#39;s apple. It should last the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>I started by drawing a scar on my forehead. It would mostly be hidden by my pitch black hair, so I reminded
          myself to occasionally brush it from my eyes. I took a few hours, perfecting my new look.</p>
        <p>Now, I stood tall in my shining armour, framing my tanned skin, pointedly staring down a prominent, manly
          nose, and sweeping back my fine black hair, I was the picture of confidence.</p>
